E.D. here, I am online and entering the first layer of P.C.B.'s atmosphere. There is a storm 52 clicks to the north east but 
it should not effect my entry.

Making my landing on the surface in 6.8 km. Deploying arm and leg thrusters to stabilize entry.
Landing successful, sending Small Exhibition Drone (S.E.D.) for arial reconnaissance.

S.E.D. has found multiple heat signatures south west of my location, initiating SCOUT PROTOCOL.

-- It's been 20 years since the first machines became sentient.--
The governments of the world clashed on the rights of those beings and attempted to halt progress with layers of red tape. 
But that didn't stop the technological explosion; we were in too deep.
After the devastation caused by the Third World War, there was no longer governmental regulation on this wasteland known as Earth. Information was everyones for the taking.
A few thousand of us were left behind after the evacuation pods were sent into the void- they were trying to save the smartest and the strongest of us all. Each settlement was sent with three years worth of supplies; they had only a little over 1,000 days to find a completely new way of life.
No one expected the rest of us to endure the nuclear fall-out, but here we are. After launching ourselves into space, we're searching-- for our loved ones, for our future.
