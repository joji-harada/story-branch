E.D. TRANSMISSION ONLINE

E.D. here, I am online and entering the first layer of P.C.B.'s atmosphere. There is a storm 52 clicks to the north east but 
it should not effect my entry.

Making my landing on the surface in 6.8 km. Deploying arm and leg thrusters to stabilize entry.
Landing successful, sending Small Exhibition Drone (S.E.D.) for arial reconnaissance.

S.E.D. has found multiple heat signatures south west of my location, initiating SCOUT PROTOCOL.

-- It's been 20 years since the first machines became sentient.--
The governments of the world clashed on the rights of those beings and attempted to halt progress with layers of red tape. 
But that didn't stop the technological explosion; we were in too deep.
After the devastation caused by the Third World War, there was no longer governmental regulation on this wasteland known as Earth. Information was everyones for the taking.
A few thousand of us were left behind after the evacuation pods were sent into the void- they were trying to save the smartest and the strongest of us all. Each settlement was sent with three years worth of supplies; they had only a little over 1,000 days to find a completely new way of life.
No one expected the rest of us to endure the nuclear fall-out, but here we are. After launching ourselves into space, we're searching-- for our loved ones, for our future.

E.D. here, again. It's been 8 hours since S.E.D found the heat signatures to the southwest. Expected return at least 4 hours ago.
Have made multiple attempts to contact, but no communication has returned. Heat signatures were not expected on Proxima Centauri B. Slowly making my way in the direction of the last signal from S.E.D. but I have very few protocols for dealing with potential hostile lifeforms. The storm to the north east is 30 clicks closer. It's possible it could be affecting communications.
If I'm unable to locate S.E.D. before the storm arrives, I will have to initiate BUNKER protocol to protect instruments and power.

E.D. here. 1 hour since last transmission. Storm is moving faster in my direction.  Have discovered what appears to be some technology partially buried in the Proxima Centauri B surface. Best identification appears to be HUMAN in construction.  Unaware of any historical references to humans coming to P.C.B. after the Third World War exodus.
Technological specimen appears to be aged; insufficient data regarding weather on P.C.B. to determine age of the technological sample.

Still unable to make contact with S.E.D. 
Will continue to examine technological sample for 10 minutes, at which time BUNKER protocol will be initiated, based on current storm trajectory and speed.
****E.D. TRANSMISSION END.
