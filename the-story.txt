E.D. TRANSMISSION ONLINE

E.D. here, I am online and entering the first layer of P.C.B.'s atmosphere. There is a storm 52 clicks to the north east but 
it should not effect my entry.

Making my landing on the surface in 6.8 km. Deploying arm and leg thrusters to stabilize entry.
Landing successful, sending Small Exhibition Drone (S.E.D.) for arial reconnaissance.

S.E.D. has found multiple heat signatures south west of my location, initiating SCOUT PROTOCOL.

-- It's been 20 years since the first machines became sentient.--
The governments of the world clashed on the rights of those beings and attempted to halt progress with layers of red tape. 
But that didn't stop the technological explosion; we were in too deep.
After the devastation caused by the Third World War, there was no longer governmental regulation on this wasteland known as Earth. Information was everyones for the taking.
A few thousand of us were left behind after the evacuation pods were sent into the void- they were trying to save the smartest and the strongest of us all. Each settlement was sent with three years worth of supplies; they had only a little over 1,000 days to find a completely new way of life.
No one expected the rest of us to endure the nuclear fall-out, but here we are. After launching ourselves into space, we're searching-- for our loved ones, for our future.

E.D. here, again. It's been 8 hours since S.E.D found the heat signatures to the southwest. Expected return at least 4 hours ago.
Have made multiple attempts to contact, but no communication has returned. Heat signatures were not expected on Proxima Centauri B. Slowly making my way in the direction of the last signal from S.E.D. but I have very few protocols for dealing with potential hostile lifeforms. The storm to the north east is 30 clicks closer. It's possible it could be affecting communications.
If I'm unable to locate S.E.D. before the storm arrives, I will have to initiate BUNKER protocol to protect instruments and power.

E.D. here. 1 hour since last transmission. Storm is moving faster in my direction.  Have discovered what appears to be some technology partially buried in the Proxima Centauri B surface. Best identification appears to be HUMAN in construction.  Unaware of any historical references to humans coming to P.C.B. after the Third World War exodus.
Technological specimen appears to be aged; insufficient data regarding weather on P.C.B. to determine age of the technological sample.

Still unable to make contact with S.E.D. 
Will continue to examine technological sample for 10 minutes, at which time BUNKER protocol will be initiated, based on current storm trajectory and speed.
****E.D. TRANSMISSION END.

BUNKER protocol terminated abrubtly. S.E.D. emergency beacon emitted from it's last known location. The beacon has increased the threat level by 12 percent for an overall 23 percent threat percentage. I will proceed with caution.
No sign of storm nearby. Exiting native structure.
The storm has wiped all tracks - both mine and native tracks are unidentifiable. Without S.E.D. I must head for higher ground for an efficient scan vantage point.
There is a small mountain about 5,250 ft tall 12 km due east. Thrusters on, estimated time to summit: 10 minutes.

I have reached the summit. Scanning ...
I have located S.E.D. by it's passive emergency signal. It appears to have been taken by the previously observed heat signatures.
The location has a series of small hollow structures, most likely a village. I am currently too far to pick up any heat signatures. I will begin my descent and approach the village now.
****E.D. TRANSMISSION END.

---------------------------------------

The ship is alive with excitement; it's the buzz that comes when one of the drones has found something. The thirty or so of us that are orbitting the atmosphere of Earth are holding our breaths.
Perhaps today is the day. Captain Bladen refuses to move us closer to P.C.B. until we have direct contact with any humans there. I don't blame him. Too many times, we have gotten prematurely excited and lost precious fuel darting around this vast universe. We need something to be conservative with what we have.
Being close to Earth for now means that we can send drones down to mine for more materials. P.C.B. is very far away and would not be an easy journey, but there is little reason for us to stay. Eventually the whole of Earth's resources with be depleted.
For now we gather, we plan, and we wait- hoping that someone will return our call.

First Officer's Log - Orbiting Earth

Since secretly breaking the encryption on the Machine's communication algorithms, news from the enemy has been slow. That they've discovered possible humans settled on P.C.B is very exciting and has been a morale boost to those of us surviving in orbit around Earth.  
I understand Captain Bladen's adamant stance on not going to P.C.B. until human existence is confirmed, but there is little left we can do at Earth. What resources are left and still usable are becoming more and more difficult to access, using up more resources to acess them.  And time, which we are also running out of.

I will talk with the captain and the other bridge crew about potential plans. While the Machines have abandoned Earth it is a relatively safe spot for us, but it will eventually become useless, and we'll need to go SOMEWHERE.  Captain Braden needs to make a choice, and I fear he is unwilling to do so.
