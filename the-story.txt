E.D. here, I am online and entering the first layer of P.C.B.'s atmosphere. There is a storm 52 clicks to the north east but 
it should not effect my entry.

Making my landing on the surface in 6.8 km. Deploying arm and leg thrusters to stabilize entry.
Landing successful, sending Small Exhibition Drone (S.E.D.) for arial reconnaissance.

S.E.D. has found multiple heat signatures south west of my location, initiating SCOUT PROTOCOL.
